# DSA_Project_3-1

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project focusing on two tasks: managing a Family Tree structure and creating a Task Scheduler.
This is a group project and has been completed under the course guidance of Prof. Chittaranjan Hota , this was taken in Sem 3-1 
We had use the following Data Structures extensively : Trees , Priority Queues and vectors 

## Task 1: Family Tree Management

### Description
This part of the project involves the implementation of a Family Tree structure with families rooted in ancestral nodes. The code manages residents moving out by replacing departing nodes with the child node boasting the highest income. Key tasks include completing code for various tree operations, identifying the family with the highest income-to-age ratio, and printing families in descending order of total income.



## Task 2: Task Scheduler

### Description
This part of the project involves the creation of a Task Scheduler. The scheduler is designed to manage and execute tasks efficiently.
